Syntax highlighting and simple folding for TeX and LaTeX log files.

This Vim syntax plugin introduces the filetype "texlog". This filetype is detected automatically for files with the .log extension and the conventional magical first line:

This is .*TeX.*, Version .*

Should filetype detection fail, you can set it yourself with ":setf texlog".
